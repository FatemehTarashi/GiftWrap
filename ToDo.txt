I am rotating the polytope far too often (I call GetUCT 5 times in my code, and that needs to decrease a bunch). I'm rotating it around when I shouldn't be, because I was trying to avoid issues I had with angles.
Instead of taking arbitrary normals to edges and then doing a UCT, I should take the normal to the edge that also goes through the known facet that the edge lies on. This means I need to rewrite my pseudocode algorithm before I do anything else.

-Currently, I'm keeping the vertices, not references to the vertices. This needs to be improved

-ALSO, think about adding in some testing for the MakeFacet routine. When I do a UCT in it, make sure all of the points lie on one side of it. Add in testing for random polytopes.
